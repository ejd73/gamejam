  - Hey, brother! Sorry, but I need to ask a favor.
  - " Mom\u2019s sitter quit. I know you haven\u2019t seen her since what happened,
    but I\u2019m up to my neck with work."
  - Do you think you could go stay with her, just for a night before we can move
    her to the hospital?
  - "\u2026"
  - "You would? Thanks. I know it\u2019s hard to imagine going back. I have to tell
    you, though. She\u2019s getting worse."
  - "The doctors said she only has another week or so, and she\u2019s not herself."

  - Who's there? Who are you?
  - Is that you, boy? Hah! Finally back after thirty years, are you? Because that
    hag decided to quit on me, eh?
  - "If you\u2019re here, it must be just about time. My last night in this shack,
    is it?"
  - "And then they\u2019ll take me away to some dank room."
  - "And that\u2019s where I\u2019ll die. "
  - No need to dwell on that. My son has returned. Oh, joy!
  - " Did you miss your childhood home? It\u2019s certainly quiet here all by myself. "
  - You look different, boy. Fatter. Like a pig. *laughs*
  - "Your room isn\u2019t ready for you. I don\u2019t care to look at it anymore.
    It\u2019s locked now."
  - 'Well, if you have to stay here for my last night, you might as well reminisce
    with your dear old mother. '
  - "Take a look around your old home. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find lots of memories,
    don\u2019t you? "

  - 'I hate this yard. Do you know why I hate it? '
  - " Because I haven\u2019t left this house in almost ten years.  "
  - "I resent the grass and the breeze and the sun because I don\u2019t remember
    how they feel.  "
  - "Tomorrow morning, I\u2019ll get to go outside. And then I won\u2019t have to
    see you anymore."
  - "I\u2019ll abandon you like you abandoned me. Hah! How do you like that? Left
    alone like I was."
  - "Until then, I\u2019m stuck with you just like you are with me. "
  - " Don\u2019t think I\u2019m happy with this little arrangement, I wish I got
    to die without seeing your face again. "
